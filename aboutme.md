Hi, I'm Greg.  I'm a newbie to SRE and DevOps, but experienced in software
development, testing, and management.  I started this blog to record some of the activities I am currently working on as I forge this new, exciting career path.

The page will not serve as a tutorial source, but will likely have some useful personal anecdotes around various implementations that I work on in my spare time.
