Hello and welcome! üëã

This is my first post to this blog.  The primary focus in the future will be around topics involving DevOps and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering), but for this first post I wanted to praise [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} for helping me get a blog running quickly, easily, and on my own terms.

### How Did I Get Here?
When I decided that I was going to start journalling this new career direction into DevOps and SRE, I needed an outlet for said activity.

I quickly remembered that I had a neglected blog over on WordPress where I had been documenting my practice of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (currently on extended hiatus).  I hit up my old account and started setting up a new blog.  Within moments, I was attempting to install a plug-in for some extra customization to support code highlighting.  I soon found out that something that simple required a paid subscription.  This sent me on the path to find an alternative solution that I had more direct control.  Enter Jekyll.

### Steps For Setting Up This Blog
Jekyll is a tool built using Ruby to build static webpages.  It allows the use of Markdown, so I knew it could be decent for creating simple blog posts quickly.

Having some Python experience, I immediately asked: "How do I install Ruby?  Is there a similar solution to pyenv, virtualenvwrapper, etc. for Ruby?".  

1) I found [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"} and installed on my Mac.  While this doesn't set up a virtual environment, it allowed me to target a specific Ruby installation that wasn't the default one for my machine.  This allowed me to have solid control over the version I was using locally to ensure it would always work in production.

Next, I set up Jekyll on my machine.

2) I followed the simple steps to install Jekyll and spin up a quick site provided by the [Jekyll Home Page](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}

Once I had a site running, I practiced writing a post and viewing locally.  I then skipped a lot of steps to figure out how to serve the site via GitHub Pages.

3) I used Mike's instructions found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqFjuX4VZmU){:target="_blank"} to deploy my site to GitHub Pages.  I'm sure there is a lot of great information in the other 18 parts of the tutorial, but Jekyll is so easy to get started that it was unnecessary for me.

After I had completed a test deployment and had an empty blog created, I felt that the blog needed a bit of a prettier face.  I wanted simple, but beautiful.  I tried a number of [themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/){:target="_blank"}, but eventually landed on [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll){:target="_blank"}.

4) I forked [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll){:target="_blank"} on GitHub and followed their instructions.  

5) After I tested a deployment, I updated the About Me, wrote this post, and pushed it to GitHub.

Overall, this was a simple process.  I like that if I ever get tired of the site's style, I can easily change or customize the theme.  It was a bit more work compared to creating something via a blog site, but I believe it was worth it for the learning experience and having total control over the site.  Plus, GitHub pages are free!

Thanks Jeykll!  üëç
